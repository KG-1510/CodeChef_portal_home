      <h1>Salut Chefs !!</h1>
 
      <br>
      <p>With enlivening events to pulling-off salient projects, factual conversations to grave club meet-ups, late-night game sessions to gossipy talks….we had a blasty blast ever since the club was brought to being. </p>
      <p>In this expedition, we swotted for intense knowledge, be it about hi-tech development , astounding creativity or dealing with the proficient corporate leaders. The trip was no ;doubt daunting and sweaty at times, but with the dedicated support of the entire team, not a sausage could refrain us from attaining it all.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">And now it’s that time, for which you all had been waiting in wings!!</p>
      <br>
      <p>CodeChef SRM extends a fair chance to all of you, to make your way into the team. 
        Whether you’re a pro at development or just a newbie at technology, we believe that you can still ace the game with our unerring guidance
      </p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Enlist in the journey of mind-boggling technical ride with </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">a twist and tang of creativity in every bit </strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>Remember...CodeChef SRM is no ordinary club that follows the old monotonous drill of recruiting students and simply pushing them to the wheel of work...eventually making it a thorn of flesh for them. We rather count on learning together and then building astonishing creations. So, without hesitancy, take a deep breath, select a corner, open the laptop and fill out the form with all your heart. If you have that zeal and desire...you’ll definitely be a cut ahead of your fellow competitors. </p>

    <h1><u>CodeChef SRM’s Ideology</u></h1>
    <p>
      CodeChef SRM gives credence to growing and succeeding cooperatively.We are a group of <br>
       like-minded coders trying to put a dent in this world. Our undertaking is to proceed with <br>
       strength of will and educate the crowd about the state of the art in technology. The key <br>
       ambition behind this initiative is to spread the gravity of competitive programming around <br>
       our campus, assisting students to find their place in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Seniors worked endlessly to ensure that the members achieved their true potential. And <br>
      that's what we expect from our young chefs. All we want from our family is to be open to <br>
      learning new things. We don’t believe in restricting our members to their central domain. <br>
      Despite this, we push them to flourish out of their zone , giving them a platform to expand <br>
      and plump for the field they find intriguing to learn. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the members striving hard to shove their boundaries are heartened and stirred up with <br>
      timely swags like CodeChef Laddus and many more to proceed with their work more <br>
      passionately and outshine tremendously.
