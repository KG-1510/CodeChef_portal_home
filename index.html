    <h1>Salut Chefs !!</h1>

    <br>
    <p>With enlivening events to pulling-off salient projects, factual conversations to grave club <br>
      meet-ups, late-night game sessions to gossipy talks….we had a blasty blast ever since the <br>
      club was brought to being. </p>
    <p>In this expedition, we swotted for intense knowledge, be it about hi-tech development , <br>
      astounding creativity or dealing with the proficient corporate leaders. The trip was no doubt <br>
      daunting and sweaty at times, but with the dedicated support of the entire team, not a <br>
      sausage could refrain us from attaining it all.</p>
    <p class="mx-3">And now it’s that time, for which you all had been waiting in wings!!</p>
    <p>CodeChef SRM extends a fair chance to all of you, to make your way into the team. <br> 
      Whether you’re a pro at development or just a newbie at technology, we believe that you can <br>
      still ace the game with our unerring guidance.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3"><strong>Enlist in the journey of mind-boggling technical ride with </p>
    <p class="mx-5">a twist and tang of creativity in every bit </strong></p>
    <p>Remember...CodeChef SRM is no ordinary club that follows the old monotonous drill of <br>
      recruiting students and simply pushing them to the wheel of work...eventually making it a <br>
      thorn of flesh for them. We rather count on learning together and then building astonishing <br>
      creations. So, without hesitancy, take a deep breath, select a corner, open the laptop and fill <br>
      out the form with all your heart. If you have that zeal and desire...you’ll definitely be a cut <br>
      ahead of your fellow competitors. </p>

      <h1><u>CodeChef SRM’s Ideology</u></h1>
      <p>
        CodeChef SRM gives credence to growing and succeeding cooperatively.We are a group of <br>
         like-minded coders trying to put a dent in this world. Our undertaking is to proceed with <br>
         strength of will and educate the crowd about the state of the art in technology. The key <br>
         ambition behind this initiative is to spread the gravity of competitive programming around <br>
         our campus, assisting students to find their place in the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Seniors worked endlessly to ensure that the members achieved their true potential. And <br>
        that's what we expect from our young chefs. All we want from our family is to be open to <br>
        learning new things. We don’t believe in restricting our members to their central domain. <br>
        Despite this, we push them to flourish out of their zone , giving them a platform to expand <br>
        and plump for the field they find intriguing to learn. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All the members striving hard to shove their boundaries are heartened and stirred up with <br>
        timely swags like CodeChef Laddus and many more to proceed with their work more <br>
        passionately and outshine tremendously.
